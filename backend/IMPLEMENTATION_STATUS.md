## Development Approach

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Infrastructure setup
- Database schema
- Authentication & authorization system
- Core services (Prisma, Audit, Activity logs)
- Reference implementation (Vets & Organizations)

### 🔄 Phase 2: Core Features (IN PROGRESS)
**Next Steps**:
1. Implement **Clients Module** (13 tasks)
2. Implement **Animals Module** (12 tasks)
3. Implement **Treatments Module** (12 tasks)
4. Implement **Memberships & Invitations** (17 tasks)

### 🔲 Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- File uploads
- Notifications
- Master Admin dashboard
- Analytics

### 🔲 Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation (Swagger)
- Monitoring & logging
- Deployment

---

## Velocity Estimate

Based on completed work:
- **Foundation** (65 tasks): ~6 hours
- **Estimated remaining**: ~12-15 hours for core features
- **Testing & deployment**: ~4-6 hours

**Total estimated time to v1**: ~22-27 developer hours

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Soft Delete**: All user-facing entities (clients, animals, treatments) use soft delete for compliance and recovery
2. **Versioning**: Treatment records are versioned on updates, old versions preserved
3. **Granular Permissions**: Delete operations and activity log access require explicit grants
4. **Organization Isolation**: Enforced via OrgScopeGuard and Prisma queries
5. **Dual Logging**: Audit logs (platform-wide) + Activity logs (org-scoped)
6. **Standard Envelope**: All responses wrapped in success/error envelope
7. **Guard Layers**: 7-layer authorization system for maximum security

---

## Notes for Remaining Implementation

All remaining modules should follow the **Organizations module** pattern:
1. Create DTOs with class-validator
2. Service with Prisma + AuditLog + ActivityLog
3. Controller with proper guards
4. Register in AppModule
5. Test endpoints

**Critical**: Ensure soft delete logic correctly cascades and preserves referential integrity.
